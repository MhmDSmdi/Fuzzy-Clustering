# Fuzzy C-Means Algorithm
It is an implementation of FCM algorithm using python.
This algorithm has some parameters that must initilize at first like: fuzziness parameter, number of clusters, number of iterations.
 * Inputs:  
    - c = number of clusters
    - iter = number of iterations
    - X = your data matrix
* Output:
    - Two plots (data, clustred data)  
    - cluster centers vector
