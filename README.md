# Fuzzy C-Means Algorithm
It is an implementation of the FCM algorithm using python. This algorithm has some parameters that must initialize at first like fuzziness parameter, number of clusters, number of iterations.
 * Inputs:  
    - c = number of clusters
    - iter = number of iterations
    - X = your data matrix
* Output:
    - Two plots (data, clustered data)  
    - cluster centers vector
